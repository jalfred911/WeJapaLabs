#Nearest Square
#Write a while loop that finds the largest square number less than an integerlimit and stores it in a variable nearest_square. A square number is the product of an integer multiplied by itself, for example 36 is a square number because it equals 6*6.

#For example, if limit is 40, your code should set the nearest_square to 36.

limit = 40

# write your while loop here

while nearest_square < limit:
    x = pow(nearest_square, 0.5) + 1
    if x * x <= limit:
        nearest_square = x * x
    else:
        break
print(nearest_square)
